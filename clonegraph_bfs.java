/**
 * Take a map to map original node to the newly created node. Put the node in to

 * its neighbors and create nodes for them too and then add them to the queue if
 * not present in the map already. And then after each iteration, add the newly
 * created neighbor to the newly created node from the map. finally return the
 * newly created for the initial node.
